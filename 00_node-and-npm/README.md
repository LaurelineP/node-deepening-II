JS is in the backend ( node ) and frontend ( browsers )
## Introduction
### What
Runtime for JS development on backend ( embedding V8 )

### Why
- great for web
- single thread based on event driven,non blocking I/O model

### When
Good for:
- API & DB behind it ( preferably NoSQL)
- data streaming ( video streaming )
- real time chat app
- server side web app
- writing same code for backend and frontend
- npm : packages for node
- widely used ( big community )
Not good for:
- app w/ heavy server-side processing(CPU intensive) -> better for php, python
